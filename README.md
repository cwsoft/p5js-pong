# ðŸ‘€ p5js - Pong

Browser implementation of the old Arcade game Pong using the great [p5js](https://p5js.org/) Javascript library. The game includes different player modes (human/computer) a counter, basic sound effects and gimmicks like increasing ball speed when ball bounces from the player paddles. Many thanks to [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) for his very inspiring [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/playlists), which made me aware of the great p5js library and inspired me to get in touch with it.

## Live Demo

You can play a live demo either with [two human players](https://cwsoft.github.io/p5js-pong/) or [human vs. computer](https://cwsoft.github.io/p5js-pong/?rightPlayer=computer) thanks to Github Pages.

## Basic Usage

1.  Download files to your computer or view [live demo](https://cwsoft.github.io/p5js-pong/)
2.  Browse index.html (or index.html?rightPlayer=computer) in a modern browser (e.g. Firefox)
3.  Press `SPACE` to start the game or `F5` to start over.
4.  Left player controls the paddle via `CURSOR_UP` and `CURSOR_DOWN` keys.
5.  Right player controls the paddle via `q` (UP) and `a` (DOWN) keys.

## Whats next

As this was my very first trial with the p5js library, game layout could possibly improved in a lot of areas. If you want to get your hands on, just download the files and change them to your needs. Possible improvements could be code clean-up and refactoring (e.g. get rid of public fields and properties, add collision detection to individual objects, add features like multiple balls or items to allow speed up of the ball etc. As my time is limited, feel free to improve or add features as you like.

Have fun
